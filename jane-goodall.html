        Jane Goodall is a British primatologist, ethnologist, and anthropologist. She is best known for her studies of chimpanzees. She was born in London in 1934. At an early age she developed a love of animals and become fascinated by Africa. In the 1950s and early 1960s, Goodall worked for Louis Leakey in Kenya and Tanzania, first as a secretary and later as a researcher. From her oberservations in the field, Goodall has provided evidence of the chimpanzee's capability to make and use tools, and has shown that the chimpanzee is not vegetarian, as was formerly believed, and can exhibit aggressive behavior.
